# Python
Python Learning Project – Internship @ Top Tech Developers
📘 About the Project
This GitHub repository contains all the files I worked on during my Python Internship at Top Tech Developers. It includes hands-on practice of Python basics, data handling using Pandas and NumPy, user-defined functions, and a real-time mini project on student data analysis with visualizations.

📂 Files in This Repository
File Name	Description
1.python basics.ipynb	Covers variables, data types, loops, conditionals, and basic syntax in Python.
2.pandas.ipynb	Introduction to Pandas: dataframes, reading CSVs, basic operations.
3.numpy.ipynb	Basics of NumPy arrays, indexing, reshaping, and array operations.
4.function and parameters.ipynb	Custom functions in Python, arguments, return values, and scope.
5.student dataset.csv	A sample dataset used to perform analysis on student performance.
6.data visualisation.ipynb	Visualization of student data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

📊 Key Concepts Practiced
✅Python fundamentals and syntax
✅Pandas for data analysis
✅NumPy for numerical operations
✅Writing custom functions
✅Data visualization (bar plots, count plots, etc.)

🔍 Mini Project: Student Dataset Analysis
Using the student dataset.csv, I performed:

✅Data cleaning and exploration
✅Analysis of marks, performance distribution
✅Visual insights using countplot, histogram, etc.
